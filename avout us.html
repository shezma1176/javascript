    <p>Astronomy is a natural science that studies everything beyond Earth's atmosphere. It looks at objects like stars,
        galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and nebulae. Astronomers also study big events like supernovae
        explosions and gamma ray bursts. This includes understanding the physics and chemistry of these objects and
        events. A related field, physical cosmology, studies the entire Universe and how it has changed over time. The
        word "astronomy" comes from Greek words meaning "star" and "law." Someone who studies astronomy is called an
        astronomer</p>
